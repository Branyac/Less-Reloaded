#Wordpress theme for thingsandcode.com based on Less Reloaded

Customizations:
- **Photo from static URL instead Gravatar**.
- **The link bar has been replaced by my name and my LinkedIn profile.**.
- **License of the contents on the footer**
- **Better readability**: I changed the color of the content to increase contrast.
- **I replaced the comments counter by the date of the post** and put it over the title of the posts.
- **SEO**:
    - **Remove `<h1 />` from `<header />`**: Because an html page should have only one title.
    - **Robots: noimageindex**: Because the relevancy of the blog is in the text.
    - **Robots: noindex**: Disable indexing for 404, pages, categories, tags, and archive. Only homepage and posts will be on search engines.
    - **Add Google Analytics**: To understand how people interact with the blog.
- **Added GDPR notice**

Feel free to download and use this theme in your page.
**REMEMBER TO CHANGE THESE THINGS BEFORE USING THIS THEME!**
- **Change the URL of the avatar and put a photo of yours**
- **Change my name and LinkedIn link for yours**
- **Delete Google Analytics tracking code from the Footer**
