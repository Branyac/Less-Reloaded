Customizations:
- **Photo from static URL instead of Gravatar**.
- **The link bar has been replaced by my name and my LinkedIn profile.**.
- **I put the license of the contents in the footer**
- **Improved readability**: I changed the color of the content to increase contrast.
- **I replaced the comments counter by the date of the post** and put it over the title of the posts.
- **SEO**:
    - **Robots: noimageindex**: Because images are not the relevant thing of this blog.
    - **Robots: noindex**: Disable indexing for 404, pages, categories, tags, and archive. Only homepage and posts are indexed on search engines.
    - **Add Google Analytics**: To understand how people interact with the blog.
    - **Disable emojis**: For faster page load times. Also I don't use emojis.
- **Bugs solved**:
    - **Remove `<h1 />` from `<header />`**: Because an html page should have only one title.
    - **Remove `role` attribute**: Removed form Header, Navigation bar, and Footer because are not necesary when using the html tags `<header />`, `<nav />`, and `<footer />`.
    - **Move the comments form outside `<ol />`** to pass w3 html validator.
- **Added GDPR notice**

Feel free to download and use this theme in your page.
**IMPORTANT: CHANGE THESE THINGS BEFORE USING THIS THEME IN YOUR WEBSITE!**
- **Change the URL of the avatar and put a photo of yours**
